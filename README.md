Parallelism - two processes are said to be executing in parallel if at any instant they are both executing.  

Concurrency - two processes are said to be concurrent if they have the potential for executing in parallel.

Task - Ada provides for the direct programming of parallel activities. Within an Ada program there may be a number of tasks, each of which has its own thread of control. Each individual thread of control within a concurrent program is known as a process, although Ada uses the term task.
