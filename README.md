Ada-concurrency (Ada Tasking Model)

# Process 
In computing, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. 

# Thread
A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, with the threads executing concurrently.

# Parallelism
Two processes are said to be executing in parallel if at any instant they are both executing.  

# Concurrency
Two processes are said to be concurrent if they have the potential for executing in parallel.

# Real-time
A system is real-time if its specification has time-dependent features.

# Task 
Ada provides for the direct programming of parallel activities. Within an Ada program there may be a number of tasks, each of which has its own thread of control. Each individual thread of control within a concurrent program is known as a process, although Ada uses the term task.
