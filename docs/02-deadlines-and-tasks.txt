Deadlines

(1) A deadline is usually defined to be absolute if it refers to a specific (future) point in time.

(2) A relative deadline is one that is anchored to the current time.

(3) If the current time is known then a relative deadline can be translated into an absolute one. 

It is an anomaly that Ada’s support for real-time does not extend as far as 
havinga direct representation for ‘deadline’, but the task attribute features 
or equivalent doesallow a deadline attribute to be assigned. 

The following gives a suitable package for the support of deadlines.

-- =======================================================
with Ada.Task_Identification; 

use  Ada.Task_Identification;

with Ada.Real_Time;

package Ada.Deadlines is

	subtype Deadline is Ada.Real_Time.Time;
	
	Default_Deadline : constant Deadline := Ada.Real_Time.Time_Last;
	
	procedure Set_Absolute_Deadline(D : Deadline;T : Task_ID := Current_Task);
	
	procedure Set_Relative_Deadline(R : Ada.Real_Time.Time_Unit; T : Task_ID := Current_Task);
	
	function Get_Deadline(T : Task_ID := Current_Task);
